# June Improvements
Here's a log of what I've changed to modernize the code for C++11, improve readability, and improve performance.
1. Switched from pass-by-value and raw pointers to unique_pointers and references
2. Switched to auto where possible
3. Removed user-defined Tour copy constructor to allow auto-generated move constructor
